# Users Service

The goal of this exercise is to start work on creating a service that provides an implementation of the [users service api](./api/users-service.yaml).

Note: A more human readable way to view the API is to view the api in [swagger's online editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuclearRedeye/api-provider/master/api/users-service.yaml).

# Some advice
